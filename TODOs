This is a TODO list so I won't forget.
Disclaimer: I tend to forget this document exists.

Quotes:
  Name quotes:
    Merge 'read' and 'random' in cmd_quote.py
    Check for double name entries, all names must be unique.
    Check that the name isn't all numbers.
  Images in quotes:
    imgurpython https://github.com/Imgur/imgurpython
    BETTER IDEA!!!!!! Post all images used in quotes to a separate image channel in MrFreeze's Cave.

Activity:
  Add a limit of 30 characters or so.
  Add a timeout for how often the activity can be changed.

Gitupdate
  Make the bot restart if it was updated.
